# The Art of Apologizing 

Recently I launched a new web project, toolittletoolate.club, an anonymous board for apologies. I was inspired by websites such as Craigslist's Missed Connections and Post Secret, sites where people put anonymous messages out into the world with the hope that someone out there will read it. Too Little Too Late was well received in the first week, and I wanted to reflect on things I learned about myself and others in the process.

As an artist working in new media I'm very interested in how  we choose to communicate with one another. Anonymity on the internet can make a very virulent space but it also allows for individuals to have free expression. In this case anonymity allows for us to say sorry for things without the risk of it being rejected.

Selfish? Maybe.

I guess I have to explain the reason I set out on making this project. I can be an incredibly verbose person. I'm not very good at expressing myself. I know deep down the feeling of being absolutely apologetic, but oftentimes when it comes to the act of apologizing the words I say don't do it justice. I will replay it over and over in my mind to craft the perfect apology, one that encapsulates everything that that I feel for that moment. By then the apology too late. Not to mention a little obsessive.

I've written hundreds of apology letters in my life. Most of them never were sent. I guess perhaps they were mostly written as a way for me to digest my feelings. But at the same time I want to get it out there.

So Too Little Too Late was born out of my desire to share some of my most obsessive apologies that would never see the light of day. I figured that someone out there would also have something that they would like to relieve themselves of.
